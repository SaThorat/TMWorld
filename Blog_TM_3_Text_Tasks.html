    <h1>Text Mining Tasks</h1>
    <p>In this article, we will be discussing various tasks that are performed as part of text mining.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Named Entity Recognition:</strong>
            <p>Here contents in the unstructured data are identified and then they are assigned to a particular category. The process of locating and classifying elements in text into predefined categories such as the names of people, organizations, places, monetary values, percentages, etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Relation Extraction (RE):</strong>
            <p>Relation Extraction is the process of identifying relationships implied in the text between a pair of entities.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Text Categorization:</strong>
            <p>Text categorization is useful to assign categories to unstructured data. It is responsible for differentiating the text into predefined categories based on their content.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Clustering:</strong>
            <p>In clustering text documents which are similar in content and nature are grouped together in the single group. Here documents in the same cluster have more common properties than documents in the other clusters.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Document Summarization:</strong>
            <p>It allows generating a summary of text data from the original document with conciseness and context.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sentiment Analysis / Opinion Mining:</strong>
            <p>Sentiment analysis is concerned with identifying and extracting the sentiments (i.e. positive, negative, neutral) of text data. This is used in text analysis to analyze subjective opinions of a particular individual.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Production of Granular Taxonomies:</strong>
            <p>Producing granular taxonomies is a process of creating hierarchical or structured classifications that categorize items, concepts, or entities into specific and detailed subcategories.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Text Generation:</strong>
            <p>Text generation is the process of automatically generating human-like text. It can be used in various applications, including chatbots, language translation, and content creation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Text Annotation:</strong>
            <p>Text annotation is the process of labeling or marking specific elements within the text, such as identifying named entities, sentiment labels, or parts of speech. These annotations are often used to train machine learning models.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Language Translation:</strong>
            <p>It is the process of converting the written words from one language into another language in a way that is culturally and linguistically appropriate so it can be understood by its intended audience.</p>
        </li>
