	<h1>What is Text Mining and Why it is Important?</h1>
    <h2>Importance of Text Mining</h2>
    <p>Data present on the Internet in the form of text is increasing day by day. Examples of text or unstructured data include news articles, blogs, log files, reports from companies in government and private sectors, interactions on social networks, product reviews from customers, research papers, patents, legal judgments, and more. It is expected that by 2025, 80% of global data will be in unstructured form. Processing unstructured data to identify interesting patterns is a challenging task for data analysts' teams. Text mining provides a solution to analyze and extract structured information from such data.</p>

    <h2>What is Text Mining?</h2>
    <p>Text mining is the process of transforming unstructured text data into structured form to identify meaningful patterns and insights. It involves various activities, starting with pre-processing the data, which includes cleaning and transforming it into a usable form. Some popular text mining techniques include Information Extraction (IE), Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. These techniques are used to perform various text mining tasks like Tokenization, Stemming, Feature selection, Feature extraction, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging, Text annotation, Summarization, Sentiment analysis, Text categorization, and more.</p>

    <h2>Applications of Text Mining</h2>
    <p>Text mining finds applications in numerous domains:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marketing and Customer Experience:</strong> <p>Text analytics helps companies gain insights into how customers perceive their brand and products through customer feedback, online reviews, and social media comments. It also uncovers emerging trends and customer preferences.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Finance:</strong> <p>Text analytics can be used to assess the market using financial news and social media analysis to make decisions on stocks. It is also useful in detecting potential fraudulent activities.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Legal AI:</strong><p> Text analytics algorithms efficiently categorize and organize large volumes of legal documents, making it easier for legal professionals to access relevant information quickly. It aids in e-discovery and reduces time and costs associated with manual document review.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong><p> Text analytics helps monitor and analyze patient reports and medical records to identify side effects related to drugs and medical devices. It provides valuable insights for healthcare professionals.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong><p> Text analytics can be used to analyze written assignments, provide automated grading and feedback, and summarize and categorize student feedback.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Human Resource:</strong><p> Text analytics automates the screening process for job applications, analyzes resumes, and identifies candidates with desired qualifications. It also assesses employee satisfaction and identifies potential issues within the organization through employee feedback, surveys, and communication analysis.</p></li>
    </ol>
