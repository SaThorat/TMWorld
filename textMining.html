            <h2>Text Mining</h2>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Text mining, also known as text data mining or text analytics, is an interdisciplinary field that
                involves the process of extracting valuable insights and meaningful patterns from unstructured text
                data. In today's information-rich world, vast amounts of textual information are generated daily through
                sources such as social media, websites, emails, documents, and more. Text mining techniques allow us to
                automatically analyze and understand this unstructured data.
                <br>
                <br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary goal of text mining is to transform textual information into structured data, enabling the
                application of various analytical methods and machine learning algorithms. By employing natural language
                processing (NLP) techniques, text mining enables tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, named
                entity recognition, and document categorization. These processes help businesses and researchers make
                data-driven decisions, extract valuable knowledge, and gain deeper insights from text-based sources.

                <br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Text mining finds applications across diverse domains, including market research, social media analysis,
                customer feedback analysis, healthcare informatics, and legal document review. As technology advances,
                text mining continues to play a crucial role in unlocking the hidden potential within textual data,
                driving innovation and improving decision-making processes across industries.
