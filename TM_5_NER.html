	<h1>Named Entity Recognition </h1>
    <strong> 1. What is Named Entity Recognition?</strong>
    <p>Named-entity recognition (NER) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, percentages, etc<br>
    NER also known as (named) entity identification, entity chunking, and entity extraction).<a href="#4">[4]</a></p>
    <b>Named-entity recognition is  two-step process :</b>
    <p>1.	Detection of the names:
    <br>Detecting an entity or keyword from the given input text. The entity can be a word or a group of words</p>
    <p>2.	Classification of the names :<br>
    Creation of entity categories such as person, Organization, Time, date, Location, percentage, money etc. and you can also create your own categories.</p>
    <p>Good training data is essential for a model to categorize detected entities into a relevant predetermined entity. Therefore, it’s vital to train the model correctly on suitable data.

    <strong>2. What are the Methods of Named Entity Recognition?</strong><br>
    <p><b>Methods of Named Entity Recognition:</b></p>
    <h4>1. Dictionary-based :</h4>
    <p>In this approach, a dictionary containing vocabulary is used. Basic string-matching algorithms check whether the entity is present in the given text against the items in the vocabulary</p>
    <h4>2. Rule-based</h4>
    <p>In this method, a predefined set of rules for information extraction is used which are pattern-based and context-based.  Pattern-based rule uses the morphological pattern of the words while context-based uses the context of the word given in the text document.</p>
    <h4>3. Machine learning-based</h4>
    <p>It is a statistical-based model that tries to make a feature-based representation of the observed data. It can recognize an existing entity name even with small spelling variations.<br>
    <b>Two Phases:</b><br>
    1. Train the ML model on annotated Documents<br>
    2.	Trained model is used to annotate the raw documents</p>
    <h4>4. Deep learning-based</h4>
    <p>Deep learning based NER possesses the ability to bring words together, enhancing its comprehension of the semantic and syntactic connections among different words.<br>
    Furthermore, it has the capacity to automatically analyze words that pertain to specific topics and possess a higher level of meaning.

    <strong>3. What are the steps involved in algorithm of Named Entity Recognition?</strong>
    <p>A typically named entity recognition NLP model consists of several subtasks, including:<br>
        <b>1. Tokenization:</b>Tokenization breaks text into individual tokens (usually words or punctuation marks).<br>
        <b>2. Part-of-speech tagging: </b>Labelling each token with its corresponding part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective, etc.).<br>
        <b>3. Chunking: </b>Group tokens into "chunks" based on their part-of-speech tags.<br>
        <b>4. Name entity recognition: </b>Identifying named entities and classifying them into predefined categories.<br>
        <b>5. Entity disambiguation: </b>The process of determining the correct meaning of a named entity, especially when multiple entities with the same name are present in the text.

    </p>

    <strong>Example:</strong>
    <p>Sentence :<br>
        <b>"Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook in 2004 in Menlo Park, California”</b><br>
        1.	Tokenize the sentence :<br>
        ['Mark', 'Zuckerberg', 'founded', 'Facebook', 'in', '2004', 'in', 'Menlo', 'Park', ',', 'California', '.']<br>
        2.	Part-of-specch Tagging:<br>
        ['NNP', 'NNP', 'VBD', 'NNP', 'IN', 'CD', 'IN', 'NNP', 'NNP', ',', 'NNP', '.']<br>
        3.	Chunking:<br>
        [('Mark', 'NNP'), ('Zuckerberg', 'NNP'), ('founded', 'VBD'), ('Facebook', 'NNP'), ('in', 'IN'), ('2004', 'CD'), ('in', 'IN'), ('Menlo', 'NNP'), ('Park', 'NNP'), (',', ','), ('California', 'NNP'), ('.', '.')]<br>
        4.	Named Entity Recognition:<br>
        { ('Mark Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('2004', 'DATE'), ('Menlo Park', 'Location'), ('California', 'Location')}<br>
        5.	Entity disambiguation :<br>
         If multiple people have the name "Mark Zuckerberg", we must determine which one is being referred to in the text.<br>

    <p><strong>What are the Benefits and Challenges of NER?</strong><br>
    Named entity recognition provides a range of advantages when used appropriately:<br>
    <div style="font-family: cursive;"> 
    <ol> 
            <li>Automates the information extraction of large amounts of data.</li>
            <li>Analyzes key information in unstructured text.</li>
            <li>Eliminates human error in analysis.</li>
            <li>Frees up time for employees to perform other tasks.</li>
            <li>Improves the precision of NLP tasks and processes.</li>
     </ol>
    
    <p>
    NER also comes with its own range of challenges:
    <ol>
        <li>Difficulty in analyzing lexical ambiguities, semantics and evolving usages of language in text.</li>
        <li>Runs into problems with spelling variations.</li>
        <li>Doesn't know all foreign words.</li>
        <li>Can have issues with spoken word text, such as telephone conversations.</li>
        <li>Leads to many state-of-the-art NER models reporting limited performance measures.</li>
        <li>Can require large volumes of training data or a lot of human intervention.</li>
        <li>Runs the risk of exhibiting bias in outcomes if the machine learning algorithm contains underlying biases.<a href="#1">[1]</a></li>
    </ol> 
    </p> 

    <strong>What are the named entity recognition applications?</strong>
    <p>NER is widely used in various NLP tasks. These include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Efficient search algorithms</li>
        <li>Content recommendations</li>
        <li>Customer support</li>
