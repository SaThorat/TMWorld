    <h1>Key Concepts and Terminologies Related to Text Mining</h1>
    <p>In this article, we will be discussing key concepts and terminologies related to text mining.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Lemmatization or Stemming:</strong>
            <p>This is a process where we will be replacing a certain word with the root/base word associated with it.
                E.g. words like running, ran, runner can all be converted to the root word run.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Tokenization or Lexical Analysis:</strong>
            <p>It is the process of separating a string of characters into tokens which may be words, phrases, or
                sentences. In the process of tokenization, generally punctuation is removed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Corpus:</strong>
            <p>This is a collection of written or spoken text stored in a well defined manner. In general corpus is entire body of work on a subject or which is created by a specific creator.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>TF-IDF (Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency):</strong>
            <p>This is statistical term which is useful to reflect how important a particular word is to a document corpus. It is made up of TF i.e. term frequency and IDF i.e. inverse document frequency. 
                TF means frequency of term in the document. It is calculated by using total occurrences of terms in the documents divided by total number of terms in the document. IDF is used to find the importance of terms in all the sets of documents. It is calculated as a log of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents containing the term specified. TF-IDF is calculated as a multiplication of these both the terms.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Parts of Speech tagging:</strong>
            <p>It is a task of labelling each word in a sentence with its appropriate part of speech. Parts of speech include nouns, verb, adverbs, adjectives, pronouns, conjunction and their sub-categories.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>N-grams:</strong>
            <p>It is sequence of `n` items from a given sequence of text or speech. 
                </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            7.	<strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> <p>It is machine`s ability to understand the human language. The NLP techniques allow a computer to process the data in human language.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Web-scrapping:</strong>
            <p>It is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Collocation :</strong>
            <p> It is series of words or terms that co-occur more often in a document. .</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Concordance :</strong>
            <p>It is used to recognize the particular context or instance in which a word or set of words appears.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Stopwords:</strong>
            <p>These are most commonly words used in a language. These words that are so common that they are basically ignored by typical tokenizers without sacrificing the meaning of the sentence. E.g. a an, the, of, in, etc. .</p>
