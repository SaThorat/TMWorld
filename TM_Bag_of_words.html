    <h1>Bag of Words</h1>
    <p>For any language the words are considered as the basic building block of that language which gives the meaning to
        the sentence and sometimes forms the complex structure. But what if we can ignore the structure of sentence and
        can focused on only the word, that’s where the concept of bag of words comes in to picture, a bag where you can
        place any word without worrying about grammar or order.</p>

    <h2>Why bag-of-words algorithm used?</h2>
    <p>The bag of words is used for various tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, training machines to
        understand human language and topic modelling. By comparing the bag of words representations of different texts,
        we can identify similarities and differences between the documents.
        The biggest problem with text data is that it is always unstructured and messy. Computers and machine learning
        algorithm prefer structured and well defined inputs and by using bag of words technique we can convert variable
        length, unstructured text into fixed length vector. Also the machine learning models work with numerical data
        rather than textual data. So to be more specific, by using the bag of words technique, we convert a text into
        its equivalent vector of numbers.

    <h2>Important Concepts/Ideas:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Collection of Words:</strong>
            <p>In the bag of words, text is broken down into individual words or tokens. These words are considered the
                fundamental units of analysis.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Disregard for Order:</strong>
            <p>The bag of words doesn't concern itself with the sequence or arrangement of words in a sentence. It
                treats every word as an isolated entity.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Text Pre-processing: </strong>
            <p> Before creating the bag of words, text preprocessing is often performed. This involves tasks like
                converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and eliminating common words (stop words) that don't
                contribute much meaning.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Counting Occurrences: </strong>
            <p> The core idea is to count how many times each word appears in the text. This count is used to build a
                representation of the text's content. Term Frequency (TF) is the count of how often a word appears in a
                specific document. It helps to identify the important words in each document</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Building a Vocabulary:</strong>
            <p> The unique words in the entire dataset make up the vocabulary. Each word becomes a "feature" in the bag
                of words representation.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sparse Representation:</strong>
            <p>The bag of words representation often results in a sparse matrix, where most elements are zeros. This is
                because each document will only have a small subset of the entire vocabulary. </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Loss of Context: </strong>
            <p>A limitation of the bag of words is that it discards the context in which words appear. It treats each
                word in isolation, potentially missing out on the meaning that arises from word relationships. </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Evolution to Advanced Models: </strong>
            <p>While the bag of words is a simple and effective starting point, more advanced techniques like TF-IDF
                (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embedding’s have been developed to capture context
                and meaning better. </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong>
            <p>The bag of words technique can be applied to large datasets and is relatively straightforward to
                implement, making it a scalable approach for text analysis </p>
        </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Creating Bag of words </h2>
    <p> For creating bag of words from given textual data following steps are followed :</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Collection :</strong>
            <p>we gather the data that we want to analyze ti can be articles reviews or just collection of sentences</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Pre-processing:</strong>
            <p>The bag of words doesn't concern itself with the sequence or arrangement of words in a sentence. It
                treats every word as an isolated entity.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Building Vocabulary :</strong>
            <p>We create a list of unique words across data set where each word becomes feature of data set.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Word Counting: </strong>
                <p>for each document, count the frequency of each word.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Constructing Bag: </strong>
                <p> a matrix where each row corresponds to documents and columns corresponds to
                words and fill the matrix with word count</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
